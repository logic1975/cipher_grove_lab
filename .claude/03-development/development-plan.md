# Comprehensive Development Plan

**Total Duration**: 20 days  
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development with 90%+ coverage  
**Methodology**: Small incremental steps with comprehensive testing after each step

## üîí CRITICAL RULE: NO STEP PROCEEDS WITHOUT TESTS
**Every [ ] substep MUST be tested before proceeding to next substep.**

### Process:
1. Write comprehensive tests first (TDD approach)
2. Implement minimum code to make tests pass
3. Verify 90%+ coverage + all tests pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Mark [x] and proceed

**Example**: ‚ùå Check boxes without testing | ‚úÖ Test each substep completely before marking [x]

- **Audio Streaming Memory**: Howler.js memory leaks, concurrent playback limits
- **Type Safety Runtime**: Prisma schema drift, API contract validation
- **Bundle Size**: Howler.js + TanStack Query + Zustand size optimization

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to defined requirements
- **Testing Delays**: Parallel testing with development where possible
- **Integration Issues**: Regular integration testing throughout development
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Have backup options for external services

### Quality Risks
- **Performance Degradation**: Continuous performance monitoring
- **Accessibility Issues**: Regular accessibility audits
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Automated security scanning
- **Browser Compatibility**: Cross-browser testing from early phases
