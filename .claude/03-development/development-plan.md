# Comprehensive Development Plan

**Total Duration**: 20 days (optimized due to early foundation completion)  
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development with 90%+ coverage  
**Methodology**: Small incremental steps with comprehensive testing after each step  
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **Phase 1 COMPLETE** (Foundation + Enhanced Database Schema)
**Next Session**: Phase 2.4 - File Storage Setup + CRUD Operations

## üîí CRITICAL RULE: NO STEP PROCEEDS WITHOUT TESTS
**Every [ ] substep MUST be tested before proceeding to next substep.**

### Process:
1. Write comprehensive tests first (TDD approach)
2. Implement minimum code to make tests pass
3. Verify 90%+ coverage + all tests pass
4. Refactor if needed
5. Mark [x] and proceed

**Example**: ‚ùå Check boxes without testing | ‚úÖ Test each substep completely before marking [x]
