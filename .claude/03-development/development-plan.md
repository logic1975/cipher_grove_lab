# Comprehensive Development Plan

**Total Duration**: 20 days (optimized due to early foundation completion)  
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development with 90%+ coverage  
**Methodology**: Small incremental steps with comprehensive testing after each step  
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **Phase 4.2 COMPLETE** (Enhanced Artist Components), ‚úÖ **ALL 597 TESTS PASSING**  
**Current Priority**: Phase 4.3 - Enhanced Music Components (MusicPlayer with Howler.js, ReleaseCard with streaming platforms)

## üîí CRITICAL RULE: NO STEP PROCEEDS WITHOUT TESTS
**Every [ ] substep MUST be tested before proceeding to next substep.**

### Standard Quality Gates (Apply to All Substeps):
1. **TDD Process**: Write tests first ‚Üí Implement minimum code ‚Üí Verify coverage
2. **Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ line coverage for all new code
3. **Test Validation**: All existing and new tests must pass
4. **Type Safety**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors
5. **Code Quality**: ESLint/Prettier compliance

**Note**: All "TEST:" descriptions below reference these standard quality gates

**Example**: ‚ùå Check boxes without testing | ‚úÖ Test each substep completely before marking [x]

## Testing Requirements by Phase

**See comprehensive testing strategy**: @.claude/03-development/testing-strategy.md

### Testing Standards for All Phases
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, implement minimum code, verify coverage
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ for all phases (enforced via Jest/Vitest configs)
- **Quality Gates**: Tests must pass before marking any substep complete
- **Testing Tools**: Vitest (frontend), Jest+Supertest (backend), Playwright (E2E)

### Phase-Specific Focus Areas
- **Phase 1-2**: Foundation testing (Prisma, database, type safety)
- **Phase 3**: API testing with comprehensive validation
- **Phase 4**: Component + state management testing  
- **Phase 5-6**: Full-stack integration and E2E workflows
- **Phase 7**: Security, accessibility, and production readiness

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Prisma Performance**: Optimize query relations, implement connection pooling
- **State Management Complexity**: Zustand store design, TanStack Query cache management
- **Audio Streaming Memory**: Howler.js memory leaks, concurrent playback limits
- **Type Safety Runtime**: Prisma schema drift, API contract validation
- **Bundle Size**: Howler.js + TanStack Query + Zustand size optimization

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to defined requirements
- **Testing Delays**: Parallel testing with development where possible
- **Integration Issues**: Regular integration testing throughout development
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Have backup options for external services

### Quality Risks
- **Performance Degradation**: Continuous performance monitoring
- **Accessibility Issues**: Regular accessibility audits
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Automated security scanning
- **Browser Compatibility**: Cross-browser testing from early phases
