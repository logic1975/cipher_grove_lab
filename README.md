# ðŸŽµ Cipher Grove Lab - Music Label Website

> **Plot twist**: This is my very first attempt at creating software! ðŸŽ­

## What's This All About?

Welcome to my musical coding adventure! I'm building a modern music label website from scratch, and documenting every stumble, breakthrough, and "oh THAT'S what a function does" moment along the way.

### The Dream ðŸŒŸ
A sleek, dark-themed website showcasing artists, releases, and news for an indie music label. Think Spotify meets your favorite underground label's aesthetic.

### The Reality ðŸ˜…
Me asking Claude things like:
- "What's the difference between frontend and backend again?"
- "Why is my code angry? It's showing red squiggly lines everywhere"
- "Is 'npm' some kind of magic spell?"

## Tech Stack (aka "Things I'm Learning to Love")

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (because apparently TypeScript prevents me from breaking things)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (the server that serves... servers?)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (it stores data and doesn't judge my queries)
- **Testing**: Jest + Vitest (because Claude insists good code needs tests)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility classes that make me feel like a CSS wizard)

## Features (Planned vs. Reality)

### âœ… What's Working
- [x] Project setup that doesn't immediately explode
- [x] Tests that actually pass (Claude's doing, not mine)
- [x] Documentation that makes sense to future-me
- [x] Git commits that aren't just "fix stuff"

### ðŸš§ What's Coming
- [ ] Artist profiles that look professional
- [ ] Music player that plays music (revolutionary concept)
- [ ] Contact forms that don't just vanish into the void
- [ ] Mobile-friendly design (because phones exist)

### ðŸŒˆ What I Dream About
- [ ] Spotify integration that actually works
- [ ] Animations that don't make people dizzy
- [ ] Code so clean it sparks joy
- [ ] Zero console errors (ambitious, I know)

## My Learning Journey ðŸ“š

**Week 1**: "What's a repository?"  
**Week 2**: "I made a button and only cried twice!"  
**Week 3**: "My code compiled on the first try... this feels suspicious"  
**Week 4**: "I understand what 'props' means now (it's not just theater)"  

## Development Philosophy

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then make them pass (Claude's idea, surprisingly effective)
2. **Documentation Everything**: Future-me will thank present-me for explaining what this code does
3. **Small Steps**: Better to make tiny progress than giant mistakes
4. **Ask Questions**: Claude never judges my "why doesn't this work?" questions
5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Successfully installing packages deserves a happy dance

## Getting Started (For Fellow Beginners)

```bash
# Clone this learning experiment
git clone https://github.com/logic1975/cipher_grove_lab.git

# Enter the musical coding zone
cd cipher_grove_lab

# Install frontend dependencies (and pray)
cd frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies (double pray)
cd ../backend
npm install

# Run tests to make sure nothing's broken
npm test

# Start the development servers and watch the magic happen
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure (aka "Where I Put Things")

```
cipher_grove_lab/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/          # The pretty stuff users see
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/           # The smart stuff that makes it work
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/           # Documentation (lots of it)
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md          # My project bible
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # You are here! ðŸ‘‹
```

## Contributing (If You're Brave Enough)

This is a learning project, so:
- **Bug reports**: "Your code doesn't work" is valid feedback
- **Suggestions**: "Maybe try not breaking everything" is appreciated
- **Pull requests**: Welcome, but remember I'm still figuring out what a merge conflict is
- **Patience**: Required when reading my commit messages

## Acknowledgments

- **Claude AI**: For not giving up on me when I asked "how do I make the computer do the thing?"
- **Stack Overflow**: For existing and having answers to questions I didn't know I had
- **Coffee**: For obvious reasons
- **My Rubber Duck**: Silent but effective debugging partner
