# ðŸŽµ Cipher Grove Lab - Music Label Website

## What's This All About?

Welcome to my musical coding adventure! I'm building a modern music label website from scratch, and documenting every stumble, breakthrough, and "oh THAT'S what a function does" moment along the way.

### The Dream ðŸŒŸ
A sleek, dark-themed website showcasing artists, releases, and news for an indie music label. Think Spotify meets your favorite underground label's aesthetic.

### The Reality ðŸ˜…
Me asking Claude things like:
- "What's the difference between frontend and backend again?"
- "Why is my code angry? It's showing red squiggly lines everywhere"
- "Is 'npm' some kind of magic spell?"

## Tech Stack (aka "Things I'm Learning to Love")

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (because apparently TypeScript prevents me from breaking things)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Prisma ORM (the server that serves... servers?)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Docker (it stores data in containers and doesn't judge my queries)
- **Testing**: Jest + Vitest + Supertest (because Claude insists good code needs tests - and wow, 258 tests!)
- **File Storage**: Express static serving with security headers (images now have a home!)
- **Validation**: Joi schemas (because users can't be trusted with form inputs)
- **Business Logic**: Enhanced services layer (I actually understand what this means now!)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility classes that make me feel like a CSS wizard)
- **Dev Environment**: Docker containers (because apparently everything lives in boxes now)

## Features (Planned vs. Reality)

### âœ… What's Working (Phase 3.1 Complete - Full REST API Built!)
- [x] Project setup that doesn't immediately explode
- [x] **Comprehensive test infrastructure (ALL 258 tests passing âœ…)**
- [x] Docker PostgreSQL database with real data
- [x] **Enhanced database schema with image fields and platform support:**
  - [x] Artists table with 8 social platforms (Instagram, Spotify, YouTube, etc.)
  - [x] Releases table with 5 streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
  - [x] News table with publish/draft workflow and auto-slug generation
- [x] Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- [x] Sample data: 3 artists, 4 releases, 3 news articles seeded
- [x] **File storage system with Express static serving + security headers**
- [x] **Business logic services layer (the heart of the system!):**
  - [x] ArtistService - Featured artist limits (max 6), social platform validation
  - [x] ReleaseService - Streaming platform validation, artist relationships
  - [x] NewsService - Publishing workflow, slug generation, search functionality
- [x] **Advanced validation with Joi schemas for all 13 platforms**
- [x] **Business rule enforcement across the entire system**
- [x] **âœ… COMPLETE REST API (91 new tests!):**
  - [x] **Artists API** - 22 tests covering full CRUD, featured limits, validation
  - [x] **Releases API** - 25 tests covering filtering, statistics, type validation
  - [x] **News API** - 44 tests covering publish workflow, search, slug handling
- [x] Security headers and CORS configuration
- [x] Comprehensive API testing with Supertest
- [x] Error handling that doesn't just crash everything
- [x] Documentation that actually helps future-me
- [x] Git commits that tell a coherent story

### ðŸš€ Current Priority (Phase 3.2 - Image Processing Next!)
- [ ] **Image upload processing with multer + sharp (make those artist photos shine!)**
- [ ] **Contact/Newsletter API endpoints with rate limiting**
- [ ] **Enhanced API middleware and validation**
- [ ] Image processing tests with file upload validation
- [ ] Multi-size image generation (thumbnails, profiles, featured)

### ðŸŒˆ What I Dream About (Phase 4+)
- [ ] **Frontend components that look professional (not like a 90s website)**
- [ ] **Music player with Howler.js that actually plays music**
- [ ] **Artist profiles with all those social platform links working**
- [ ] Contact forms that don't just vanish into the digital void
- [ ] Spotify integration that actually works
- [ ] Animations that don't make people dizzy
- [ ] Code so clean it sparks joy
- [ ] Zero console errors (ambitious, I know)

## My Learning Journey ðŸ“š

**Week 1**: "What's a repository?"  
**Week 2**: "I made a button and only cried twice!"  
**Week 3**: "My code compiled on the first try... this feels suspicious"  
**Week 4**: "I understand what 'props' means now (it's not just theater)"  
**Week 5**: "I wrote a service class and it actually works!"  
**Week 6**: "165 tests? I'm basically a developer now!"  
**Week 7**: "Understanding business logic validation feels like unlocking a superpower"  
**Week 8**: "File storage, enhanced schemas, platform validation - I built the foundation!"  
**Week 9**: "Honest assessment: 36 tests failing, but the services layer is solid!"  
**Week 10**: "Documentation accuracy matters - fixed all the progress tracking!"  
**Week 11**: "BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed all test issues! 165 tests passing - full TDD compliance!"  
**Week 12**: "PHASE 3.1 COMPLETE! Built a full REST API with 91 new tests - 258 total tests passing!"  

## Development Philosophy

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then make them pass (Claude's idea, surprisingly effective)
2. **Documentation Everything**: Future-me will thank present-me for explaining what this code does
3. **Small Steps**: Better to make tiny progress than giant mistakes
4. **Ask Questions**: Claude never judges my "why doesn't this work?" questions
5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Successfully installing packages deserves a happy dance

## ðŸ“š Learning Resources (NEW!)

This project now includes comprehensive documentation for different learning levels:

### **For Beginners** 
- **README.md** (this file): Friendly project overview with honest progress tracking
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project-specific development standards and achievement tracking

- **`.claude/README.md`**: Enterprise documentation navigation index
- **`.claude/03-development/`**: Professional development processes, testing strategies, troubleshooting

### **For Computer Science Students**
- **`explain_the_codebase.md`**: 3-level learning guide (849 lines!)
  - **Level 1**: The Big Picture (beginner-friendly)  
  - **Level 2**: Advanced Architecture (professional patterns)
  - **Level 3**: Computer Science Deep Dive (theoretical foundations)

### **For Enterprise Learning**

- **`.claude/06-domain/`**: Business rules and domain-driven design
- Complete enterprise-grade project documentation

## Getting Started (For Fellow Beginners)

```bash
# Clone this learning experiment
git clone https://github.com/logic1975/cipher_grove_lab.git

# Enter the musical coding zone
cd cipher_grove_lab

# Start the database (Docker magic)
cd backend
npm run db:start

# Install backend dependencies and setup database
npm install
npm run setup

# Install frontend dependencies (and pray)
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Run tests to make sure nothing's broken
cd ../backend
npm test

# Start the backend development server
npm run dev

# In a new terminal, start the frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

## Development Server

### Frontend Development
To start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The server will:
- Start on http://localhost:5173
- Open your browser automatically
- Provide hot module replacement (HMR)

If you encounter port conflicts:
```bash
# Check what's using port 5173
lsof -i :5173

# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```
