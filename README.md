# ðŸŽµ Cipher Grove Lab - Music Label Website

## What's This All About?

Welcome to my musical coding adventure! I'm building a modern music label website from scratch, and documenting every stumble, breakthrough, and "oh THAT'S what a function does" moment along the way.

### The Dream ðŸŒŸ
A sleek, dark-themed website showcasing artists, releases, and concerts for an indie music label. Think ECM Records meets modern web design.

### The Reality ðŸ˜…
Me asking Claude things like:
- "What's the difference between frontend and backend again?"
- "Why is my code angry? It's showing red squiggly lines everywhere"
- "Is 'npm' some kind of magic spell?"

## Tech Stack (aka "Things I'm Learning to Love")

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (because apparently TypeScript prevents me from breaking things)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Prisma ORM (the server that serves... servers?)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Docker (it stores data in containers and doesn't judge my queries)
- **Testing**: Jest + Vitest + Supertest (because Claude insists good code needs tests - and wow, 518 tests!)
- **File Storage**: Express static serving with security headers (images now have a home!)
- **Validation**: Joi schemas (because users can't be trusted with form inputs)
- **Business Logic**: Enhanced services layer (I actually understand what this means now!)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with ECM-inspired design (Tailwind was removed - too many conflicts!)
- **Dev Environment**: Docker containers (because apparently everything lives in boxes now)

## Features (Planned vs. Reality)

### âœ… What's Working (Backend Complete + Frontend in Progress!)

## My Learning Journey ðŸ“š

**Week 1**: "What's a repository?"  
**Week 2**: "I made a button and only cried twice!"  
**Week 3**: "My code compiled on the first try... this feels suspicious"  
**Week 4**: "I understand what 'props' means now (it's not just theater)"  
**Week 5**: "I wrote a service class and it actually works!"  
**Week 6**: "165 tests? I'm basically a developer now!"  
**Week 7**: "Understanding business logic validation feels like unlocking a superpower"  
**Week 8**: "File storage, enhanced schemas, platform validation - I built the foundation!"  
**Week 9**: "Honest assessment: 36 tests failing, but the services layer is solid!"  
**Week 10**: "Documentation accuracy matters - fixed all the progress tracking!"  
**Week 11**: "BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed all test issues! 165 tests passing - full TDD compliance!"  
**Week 12**: "PHASE 3 COMPLETE! Built a full REST API with 453 backend tests!"  
**Week 13**: "Frontend underway - layout components done, 65 tests passing!"  
**Week 14**: "Documentation alignment - News descoped, Concerts added to roadmap!"  

## Development Philosophy

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then make them pass (Claude's idea, surprisingly effective)
2. **Documentation Everything**: Future-me will thank present-me for explaining what this code does
3. **Small Steps**: Better to make tiny progress than giant mistakes
4. **Ask Questions**: Claude never judges my "why doesn't this work?" questions
5. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Successfully installing packages deserves a happy dance

## ðŸ“š Learning Resources (NEW!)

This project now includes comprehensive documentation for different learning levels:

- Complete enterprise-grade project documentation

## Getting Started (For Fellow Beginners)

```bash
# Clone this learning experiment
git clone https://github.com/logic1975/cipher_grove_lab.git

# Enter the musical coding zone
cd cipher_grove_lab

# Start the database (Docker magic)
cd backend
npm run db:start

# Install backend dependencies and setup database
npm install
npm run setup

# Install frontend dependencies (and pray)
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Run tests to make sure nothing's broken
cd ../backend
npm test

# Start the backend development server
npm run dev

# In a new terminal, start the frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

## Development Server

### Frontend Development
To start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The server will:
- Start on http://localhost:5173
- Open your browser automatically
- Provide hot module replacement (HMR)

If you encounter port conflicts:
```bash
# Check what's using port 5173
lsof -i :5173

# Kill the process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```
